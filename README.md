Last year project (Individual Project)

This project is based on a a GUI Tool that was developed to support C developer to write code for a specific micrcontroller.
The chosen micrcontroller is the PIC16877A, designed by a company called MIcrochip. 
Its main function is is to translate a given C program into a Assembly program, specific for the chosen pic. 
The translation is done via an analysis phases, where regular expression was heavily used and a code generation phase. 
The tool is fully written in Java and has been proven to be very useful compare to the similar solution out there.
